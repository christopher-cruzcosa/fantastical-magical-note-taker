# fantastical-magical-note-taker
A human resources tracker for team leaders to organize their personnel information.

## Installation

This web app is made up of one a server.js file controlling the server routes, a public file that has the two html files rendered, a css file, a image folder, and an index.js file that controls the front end.  This app is also dependent on the express module for server routing.


The application is deployed to: https://sheltered-plains-29662.herokuapp.com/

## Usage 

The user is first sent to a main page, which links to the notes page.  That page has all previous notes on the left side and the main right side is where a new note is written and then saved.  Notes only have a title and text area.  The saved notes on the left side can be deleted by clicking the trash can icon next to each one.

Below is screenshot of the main notes section.
